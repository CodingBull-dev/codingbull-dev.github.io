# Coding Bull
Welcome to Coding Bull!

This is the code used to generate the site [codingbull.dev](https://codingbull.dev).

Follow us [in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingBull-Dev)!

It is powered by [`11ty`](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## Development

- Download the repository
- `npm install`
- `npm start` to have hot reloading.
	- The site will be rendered in `http://localhost:8080`
- `npm run build` to generate a production build in the `/dist` directory

## Deployment

Every time that the repository receives a push to the main branch, it will build and upload the site.
